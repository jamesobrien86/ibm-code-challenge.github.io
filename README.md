Code Challenge - Build a Image gallery using the Pixabay API


# Pixabay Gallery Concept
Concept comes from a virtual art gallery, an api linked to each gallery which can called on at a click of a button.
The idea is to help people see more of thr art world and be able to engage on a social level in real time.

To interact simple click your gallery and an exhibtion would be called over the api, once its loaded you will be able to view each piece in the exhibtion and see all the information about it but also comment in realtime to other people viewing the art.
